Merge (or merge down) directories and files into one target directory.

* note: only merge down is currently supported
* remaining empty folders will be moved to the trash.
* files with duplicate file names, but different crc32, will be moved into a sub-directoryi n the target location
* user's home directory will be used as a target, if source file's parents are in different locations
* if you populate the file ~/.config/local.lcars.merge/deletions with basenames or file extensions, files matching those entries will be deleted instead of merged; file extensions need to be in lowercase and have the format '*.<ext>', e.g. '*.exe'

Merge down single directory:
merge -d foo

Merge down several directories or files into one target directory:
merge -d foo bar baz
